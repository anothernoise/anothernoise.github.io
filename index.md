**Solution & Data Architect**

I design resilient, analytics-ready platforms for **Health & Life Sciences** — from clinical data to multi-omics research. I also bring cross-industry experience in **banking, telecom, and retail**, applying proven data patterns to regulated environments.

With **10+ years** in data and cloud architecture, I build cloud-native platforms on **AWS, GCP, and Azure** that modernize data foundations, protect sensitive information, and accelerate insights for clinicians, researchers, and product teams. My current focus is **biotech and healthcare** data platforms and analytics.

## Focus – Health & Life Sciences

I help healthcare providers, biotech companies, and healthtech teams build **secure, interoperable data platforms** that move from raw signals to clinical and research insight quickly and safely.

- **Data platforms & interoperability:** Architect HIPAA-aligned platforms spanning clinical workflows, real-world data, and payer datasets with **FHIR/HL7** integration, lineage, and consent-aware access.
- **Omics and research data:** Design end-to-end pipelines for **genomics, proteomics, imaging**, and other multimodal data with harmonized metadata and reproducible processing.
- **Governed analytics & AI:** Enable self-service analytics, semantic layers, and AI-assisted use cases (e.g., decision support, RAG on governed data) on **Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, and lakehouse** patterns.

I bridge engineers, clinicians, and researchers—speaking the language of both delivery teams and scientific stakeholders.

## Cross-industry foundations

Experience across **banking, telecom, and retail** provides the reliability, governance, and cost discipline I apply to regulated HLS environments.

- **Banking & fintech:** Risk/fraud analytics, regulatory reporting, customer 360, and audit-ready streaming/batch pipelines.
- **Telecom:** Network and customer analytics, churn prediction, and migrations from legacy DWH to cloud **lakehouse** architectures.
- **Retail & e-commerce:** Sales and inventory analytics, pricing/promo performance, marketing attribution, and executive dashboards.

These domains taught me to **treat data as a product** and design platforms that survive scale, regulation, and fast-changing requirements—directly strengthening my work in **biotech and healthcare**.

## Selected work

- **Healthcare analytics stack modernization:** Streaming **FHIR ingestion**, unified patient 360 model, and governed self-service BI to reduce time-to-insight for clinical teams.
- **Multi-omics research platform:** Combined sequencing data, clinical registries, and imaging assets with harmonized metadata and lineage for reproducible cohort selection and analysis.
- **Genomics data pipelines:** Variant-processing with QC, metadata management, and curated outputs ready for downstream statistics and ML.
- **Telecom lakehouse migration:** Guided a telecom provider from a monolithic on-prem DWH to a cloud lakehouse, improving reliability and enabling near–real-time reporting.
- **Retail analytics & BI:** Consolidated POS, e-commerce, and marketing data into a unified analytics layer and executive dashboards, boosting visibility into margin and promotion performance.

Across these projects, the common themes are **trusted data, explainable architecture, and measurable business impact**.

## How I work

- Operate at the intersection of **architecture, delivery, and stakeholder alignment**, translating between clinicians/researchers, product, and engineering.
- Favor **clear data contracts, domain boundaries, and ownership** so platforms stay maintainable as teams and use cases grow.
- Design pipelines and platforms to be **robust, governed, and analytics-ready** from day one, with observability and cost control built in.
- Practice pragmatic, incremental delivery—starting with **proofs of concept** and hardening into production systems tied to clear value and KPIs.
- Mentor teams on modern data practices: data as a product, semantic modeling, and responsible use of AI on regulated data.

## Notes

```scala
val data = pipeline()
  .ingest()
  .cleanup()
  .enrich()
  .publish()
```

A simple philosophy for data work: clear stages, automated pipelines, and reproducible outcomes that turn raw signals into trusted products.
